    <p>These are some of my favorite memories of us together. Whether we're having a night on the town or staying in, we always end of having a great time together.
        I couldn't imagine doing this with anyone else. I love you!!!

      <h3>December 3rd</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">OTR</p>
      <p>This day was truly epic. It had been a little while since we had went out into the city, and I'm so glad we did it. I love how we're also
        beginning to do this more! Also this picture of you is so silly.

      <h3>June 19th</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Harley's Birthday</p>
      <p>I absolutely love this picture of us. This is definitely one of our best pictures we have ever taken together. The look on both of our faces
        really shows how happy we were in this moment. Additionally, this day was incredibly fun!

      <h3>January 15th</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Silly Picture</p>
      <p>I don't know why, but for whatever reason I absolutely love this picture. I feel like it illustrates how silly our relationship can be, which
        is crazy because I feel as if you and I were much more straight and normal towards the beginning of our relationship. Whenever I look at this picture,
        I can't help but feel that this was the turning point when you and I became much more open with each other, and as a result, more silly.

      <h3>December 25th</h3>
      <p class="w3-opacity">Christmas Selfie</p>
      <p>This was the first time I had you meet my extended family, which was really exciting for me. For me, this was an incredible milestone for 
        our relationship. I'm so happy that my family adores you, and I can't wait for you to be at our next christmas party. It's really important for me 
        that my family likes you, and I can't believe how lucky I was to have someone as amazing as you. I'm so happy that my family always asks about you, you mean so much to me!!!
